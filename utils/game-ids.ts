// The Bad Api has its own Game IDs â€” variable length hexadecimal strings.
// Trying to use those in my own DB sounded like a recipe for even more
// lost sleep, so I needed some way to generate ids for games based on
// the Bad Api's ids. Since cryptographic hashes would be a waste of
// resources, I opted for xxhash, and tried to further minimise the
// performance hit of constantly hashing Bad Api's ids by using a wasm
// module instead of a pure js one.
