                        pre-assignment project. I wrote it with a very
                        constrained schedule, and decided to focus my time and
                        energy more on learning something new (e.g. database
                        stuff) than on the parts {"I'm"} more at home with (i.e.
                        frontend stuff) ‚Äî I wanted to make a really polished and
                        well organised UI with some nice little animations and
                        microinteractions with e.g. Framer Motion but ended up
                        learning a ton about things like keyset pagination (I
                        left some code related to it in the repo, even though{" "}
                        {"it's"} unused), synchronisation problems, and database
                        management!
